# Art Generation using Neural Style Transfer using Deep Learning
Here, we will implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm. Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning.It merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.
